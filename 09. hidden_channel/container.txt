THE TURN OF THE SCREW (ALSO KNOWN AS GHOST STORY: THE TURN OF THE SCREW) IS A BRITISH TELEVISION FILM BASED ON HENRY JAMES'S 1898 GHOST STORY OF THE SAME NAME. COMMISSIONED AND PRODUCED BY THE BBC, IT WAS FIRST BROADCAST ON 30 DECEMBER 2009, ON BBC ONE. THE NOVELLA WAS ADAPTED FOR THE SCREEN BY SANDY WELCH, AND THE FILM WAS DIRECTED BY TIM FYWELL. ALTHOUGH GENERALLY TRUE TO THE TONE AND STORY OF JAMES'S WORK, THE FILM IS SET IN THE 1920S—IN CONTRAST TO THE ORIGINAL 1840S SETTING—AND ACCENTUATES SEXUAL ELEMENTS THAT SOME THEORISTS HAVE IDENTIFIED IN THE NOVELLA. THE FILM'S STORY IS TOLD IN FLASHBACKS DURING CONSULTATIONS BETWEEN THE INSTITUTIONALISED ANN (MICHELLE DOCKERY) AND DR FISHER (DAN STEVENS). ANN TELLS HOW SHE WAS HIRED BY AN ARISTOCRAT (MARK UMBERS) TO CARE FOR THE ORPHANS MILES (JOSEF LINDSAY) AND FLORA (EVA SAYER). SHE IS MET AT THE CHILDREN'S HOME, BLY, BY MRS GROSE (SUE JOHNSTON), THE HOUSEKEEPER. ANN SOON BEGINS TO SEE UNKNOWN FIGURES AROUND THE MANOR, AND SEEKS AN EXPLANATION.\n\nCRITICS WERE DIVIDED IN THEIR REVIEWS OF THE TURN OF THE SCREW. THE ACTING AND TONE OF THE PRODUCTION WERE GENERALLY PRAISED, BUT THE PLOT'S DIVERGENCES FROM THE ORIGINAL STORY WERE LESS WELL RECEIVED. A PARTICULAR DISAGREEMENT CONCERNED THE FILM'S HORRIFIC ELEMENTS; SOME CRITICS CONSIDERED IT TO BE GENUINELY SCARY, WHILE OTHERS SUGGESTED THAT THE HORROR WAS NOT FULLY EFFECTIVE. THE ORIGINAL STORY HAS BEEN MUCH ANALYSED OWING TO ITS AMBIGUITY, AND CRITICS DISAGREED ABOUT THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE FILM SUCCEEDED IN PORTRAYING THIS TRAIT. ACADEMIC ANALYSES FOUND THE FILM CONSIDERABLY LESS AMBIGUOUS THAN THE NOVELLA. THE TURN OF THE SCREW WAS RELEASED ON DVD ON 1 MARCH 2010 IN THE UK AND ON 28 APRIL 2015 IN NORTH AMERICA.
